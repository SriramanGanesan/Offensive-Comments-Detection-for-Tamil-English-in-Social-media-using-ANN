# Offensive-Comments-Detection-for-Tamil-English-in-Social-media-using-ANN
This repository contains code of Homophobia and Transphobia detection for Tamil-English language in Social media comments using Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The ANN provides a robust perfomance, withy a accuracy of 89% for non preprocessed data and 87% for preprocessed data. By comparing with other classifiers like Logistic Regression (LR), Na√Øve Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and mBert, it was clear that ANN outperfoms with highest accuracy. 

The Architecture diagram is given below:

This repository contains the public dataset of Tamil-English offensive comment (preprocessed and non preprocessed) as CSV file obtained from raw TSV file by using Dataset preprocessing.ipynb. The compared 8 classifiers were available in comparison clasifiers.ipynb file and the accuracy obtained from mbert is available in mbert ipynb file.
